AnkhBERT-DBP: Leveraging Ankh Language Models and Convolutional BERT for
DNA-Binding Protein Prediction


DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play fundamental roles in cellular processes, including gene regulation, DNA repair, and chromatin remodelling, making their accurate identification crucial for biomedical research and therapeutic development. Traditional experimental methods for DBP identification remain labour-intensive and limited in scalability. This study introduces AnkhBERT-DBP, a novel deep learning framework that leverages Ankh protein language model embeddings integrated with Convolutional BERT (ConvBERT) architecture for enhanced DBP prediction from primary sequences alone. Unlike existing approaches that depend on handcrafted evolutionary features or multiple language models, our method leverages a single pre-trained embedding model and a convolution-attention fusion network to capture both local motifs and global sequence dependencies. Evaluated on the challenging PDB186 independent test set, AnkhBERT-DBP achieves state-of-the-art results, including 92.47% accuracy, 96.77% sensitivity, 0.85 MCC, and 0.969 AUC, surpassing previous leading methods such as CoSEF-DBP and PredDBP-PLMs. These findings demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of AnkhBERT-DBP for DBP classification using only raw sequence data
